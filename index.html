                <h1>Jackie Rose</h1>
                <p>I am currently working towards obtaining my Associates in Graphic Design from College of DuPage in the next semester and then transferring to Elmhurst College in Fall 2020. I hope to obtain my Bachelors in Graphic Design from Elmhurst while minoring in communications and sociology. My professional strengths are leadership, public speaking, and communication, while my design strengths are illustration, 3D design, and packaging design. I have a background in photography, ceramics, drawing, and prop making. My personal strengths are vector renders and character design. My prior work experience includes various leadership positions in extracurricular activities, working as lead Student Ambassador for the College of DuPage, New Student Orientation Leader for the College of DuPage, as well as tournament organizer, lead commentator, and head of advertising for College of DuPage, Depaul University, and Elmhurst College E-Sports. Currently I am also working as a freelance graphic designer, mainly for personal logos and event advertising.
